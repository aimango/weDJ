=====
Social application for attendees of an event to suggest songs to a playlist,
and for hosts to administer the playlist.

Simple, fun, and interactive.

Note that this is not a working web app, but just a simulation.

Contributions: Group Hackathon at Google Fuse 2011. Experimented with html5, webkit, css, all that jazz.
